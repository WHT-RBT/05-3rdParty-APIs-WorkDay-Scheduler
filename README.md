05-Third-Party APIs Work Day Scheduler

USER STORY:

Work Day Scheduler is a simple online calendar that allows a user to save events for each hour of a work day. This scheduler will run in the browser, allowing the user to save and retrieve data from the web browser's local storage.

The Work Day Scheduler will display the current date in the calendar header and will update daily.

The user will be offered timeblocks for standard business hours that will be color coded for Past (gray), Present (red) and future (green).

The user will be allowed to save their calendar of events and appointments by entering their details, then clicking the save button to save it into the scheduler. This data will be available to the user even after refreshing, and the user will be able to continue editting, saving, and displaying their schedule without losing data.
